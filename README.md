Hello eveyone!
This is my first repo so please excuse me for any issue in the code
you can notify me with your thoughts and pitch me anytime.....
Before using this we should have download pre-requirities:
1)Install streamlit and nltk:
   pip install streamlit nltk
2)import the needed files
3)Then run the streamlit using:
  streamlit run <filename.py>
Install the required libraries: If you haven't already, install streamlit and nltk:
pip install streamlit nltk
Download NLTK WordNet data: If you haven't done this yet, you'll need to download the necessary NLTK data for WordNet:
import nltk
nltk.download('wordnet')
Modify the app to take user input for a word: We can adjust the app to allow users to input a word manually. The app will then return the synonyms for that word using the WordNet API from NLTK.Additional Considerations:
Handling Multiple Synonyms: The app displays the synonyms as a list. You can enhance it by filtering out duplicates, sorting them, or providing more advanced synonym options (e.g., filtering by part of speech).

Part of Speech: If you want to improve the accuracy of synonyms, you can incorporate word types (e.g., noun, verb, adjective) when calling wordnet.synsets(). WordNet has different sets of synonyms for different parts of speech.

You can modify the get_synonyms function to allow the user to select a part of speech, for
Synonym Finder in Python
A Synonym Finder is a tool that helps to identify words that have similar meanings to a given word. In Python, we can use several methods and libraries to find synonyms, with the most common being:

NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit): Using WordNet (a lexical database of English).
spaCy: Another NLP library that provides powerful tools, although its synonym finding might require additional custom logic or integration with WordNet or other sources.
PyDictionary: A Python wrapper around the Google search API that can be used to find synonyms and meanings.
Here, we'll cover a few approaches for building a Synonym Finder using Python.
